## Introduction 
In HW3: Lighting and Materials in GLSL, we used a simple Phong reflectance model to model lighting. However, this simple model assumes that all materials are opaque and the reflected light leaves the surface exactly where it entered, as shown in the following figure:

![sss_local](figures/sss_entry.png)

However, many materials are translucent in real life, meaning that light can penetrate a nonzero length into the surface. These light diffuse inside of the material, and exits the surface at some point way from the initial entry point, as shown in the following figure:

![sss_nonlocal](figures/sss_nonlocal.png)

This physical behaviour generates the following appearance for textures like jade, marble, or human skin:

To correctly model this behaviour, the ultimate method is to use path tracing to directly model the light paths scattering inside of the material. However, this leads to long render time and is undesirable for real-time rendering. In this final project, I will implement several real-time subsurface scattering (abbreviated as SSS in the following) algorithms that allows for real-time rendering of translucent surfaces.

## Proposal

I will survey real-time SSS algorithms, implement them, and compare their performances. I will implement the algorithms described in the following papers (or more), depending on time:
